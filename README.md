Try-Anything-Once
=================

I've found that an effective way to learn the features of a language, framework, library, etc. is to write random code with little consideration for code quality/maintainability just to try things out quickly.

I've also found that since this is such meaningless code I'm writing, I don't generally keep it organized or backed-up.

Therefore, the purpose of this repo is to allow me to look back at the monstrosities I've created.
